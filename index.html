    &emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;I also developed a hobby of drawing a picture and painting<br> 
    &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  as well. I hope to draw astonishing drawings in the future. <br>
    &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I love reading novels in my spare time. I aspire to  <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;become an independent woman.

                        <p>Art is the way to speak without words. It is a <br>
                             process of seeing ourselves deep inside and reflect<br>
                              our inner feeling out with the help of our drawing <br>
                              tools. Every points, lines of a painting have their<br>
                               own meanings, the way they are lined, their thickness<br>
                                and also the shades and color… all of it. It is an <br>
                                expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation<br>
                                 of certain artistic qualities, having its unique visual <br>
                                 language.  I can say it is a visual book. For the one <br>
                                 who understands, it is capable of telling the message <br>
                                 it carries. I can put the artist is on the place of the<br>
                                  writer, the painting board is the paper, the paint <br>
                                  colors are the ink of the pen, the paint brush is the<br>
                                   pen and the story is the beautiful mix of colors <br>
                                   telling the story from the beginning till the end. <br>
                                   It endows freedom. <br>
                            I never thought that I would be this kind of talented<br>
                            artist, well now I am. And I am proud to be. My friends <br>
                            and family members used to tell me that I should keep up<br>
                            my good works and also continue to draw, I think I should <br>
                            follow their advice. Once, the greatest writer said,<strong> “…for<br>
                            the eye sees not itself but by reflection, by some other <br>
                            things”.</strong>
