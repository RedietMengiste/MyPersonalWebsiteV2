                                <p>
                                    Hello Everyone, <br>
                                    As you all know I'm a great fan of Drawings and paintings (collectively Art). I developed the habbit of drawing since I was a child and I have always wondered to be a talented artist. One day my elder sister told me about Leonardo da Vinci and his famous renaissance painting of monalisa,I was amazed by its detailed and sophisticated masterpiece. Since then I tried to dig more about famous ancient artists and learn a lot from them.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Leonardo da Vinci</h5>   
                                <p>Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was a painter, architect, inventor, and student of all things scientific. His natural genius crossed so many disciplines that he epitomized the term “Renaissance man.” Today he remains best known for his art, including two paintings that remain among the world’s most famous and admired, Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Art, da Vinci believed, was indisputably connected with science and nature. Largely self-educated, he filled dozens of secret notebooks with inventions, observations and theories about pursuits from aeronautics to anatomy. But the rest of the world was just beginning to share knowledge in books made with moveable type, and the concepts expressed in his notebooks were often difficult to interpret. </p> 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>The first is da Vinci’s <strong> The Last Supper</strong> ,painted during his time in Milan, from about 1495 to 1498. A tempera and oil mural on plaster, <strong> The Last Supper</strong> was created for the refectory of the city’s Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p>    
                            <li>
                               <p>When Milan was invaded by the French in 1499 and the Sforza family fled, da Vinci escaped as well, possibly first to Venice and then to Florence. There, he painted a series of portraits that included <strong> La Gioconda</strong>, a 21-by-31-inch work that’s best known today as  <strong>Mona Lisa.</strong> Painted between approximately 1503 and 1506, the woman depicted—especially because of her mysterious slight smile—has been the subject of speculation for centuries. In the past she was often thought to be Mona Lisa Gherardini, a courtesan, but current scholarship indicates that she was Lisa del Giocondo, wife of Florentine merchant Francisco del Giocondo. Today, the portrait—the only da Vinci portrait from this period that survives—is housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where it attracts millions of visitors each year.</p>

                                <h5>Vincent Van Gogh</h5>
                                <p>Vincent van Gogh, in full Vincent Willem van Gogh, born March 30, 1853, Zundert, Netherlands—died July 29, 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France. He is a Dutch painter, generally considered the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn, and one of the greatest of the Post-Impressionists. The striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms of his work powerfully influenced the current of Expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh’s art became astoundingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century, when his work sold for record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and was featured in blockbuster touring exhibitions. In part because of his extensive published letters, van Gogh has also been mythologized in the popular imagination as the quintessential tortured artist.</p>    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In 1880, at the age of 27, he decided to become an artist. He moved around, teaching himself to draw and paint and receiving financial support from Theo. In 1886, Van Gogh joined Theo in Paris, and met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. His style changed significantly under the influence of Impressionism, becoming lighter and brighter. He painted a large number of self-portraits in this period.</p>

                                <h5>Pablo Picasso</h5>
                                <p>Pablo Ruiz was born in Malaga on 25 October 1881, the son of an art teacher. He later adopted his mother's maiden name of Picasso. He grew up in Barcelona, showing artistic talent at an early age. In the early 1900s, he moved between France and Spain before finally settling in Paris in 1904. There he experimented with a number of styles and produced his own original ones, reflected in his 'Blue' and 'Rose' periods.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p>Unlike many artists, Picasso remained in Paris during the German occupation. From 1946 to his death he lived mainly in the south of France. He continued to produce a huge variety of work including paintings, sculptures, etchings and ceramics.</p></li>
